# Criminal-Database
A brief description of project is :-
  
  It is a criminal database of Punjab. A person can search criminals according to queries like name, father's name, city, crime type or crime year.

  We have divided the project into different frames that are required to complete our project. Now, I will explain them 
  one by one according to their position in java application.
  1. AuthenticationPortal.java -- In this java form there will be two option for a person to login i.e. He can either be a      Master or a Simple user. A Master can add a criminal record and search for the criminal also, while a Simple user can      only search for a criminal.
  2. UserAndMasterSearch.java -- If a person is logged in as a Simple user then he will be advanced directly to this page.      And we have also made this form keeping broad view of the other module i.e. Master user will also be advanced to this      page if he chooses to search for a criminal.
  3. SearchDisplay.java -- It is a form where search results will be displayed in the well designed table format.
  4. MasterAuthentication.java -- If a person is logged in as a Master user then he will be advanced to a form where there      will be two buttons one to search for a criminal and one two add a criminal to database.
  5. addCriminal.java -- If a Master user chooses to add a criminal to database then he/she will be advanced here, where        he/she can enter queries related with criminal and submit it to database.
